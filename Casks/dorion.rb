    <<~EOS
      If opening Dorion gives you "Dorion.app is damaged and cannot be opened", MacOS is lying to you and you may just need to run:

        sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Dorion.app

      Alternatively, you can open the Privacy & Security settings pane and scroll down to the Security section to remove the quarantine.
